Let me break down the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, she bought 3 dozen donuts. Hmm, okay, so that's 3 times a dozen. I remember that a dozen is 12, so 3 times 12 is 36 donuts. Each dozen of donuts costs $68. So, I need to calculate the total cost for the donuts. Let me write that down: 3 doxen (which is another word for dozen) times $68. So, 3 * 68. Let me do that multiplication. 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 8 is 24, so adding those together, 180 + 24 is 204. So, the donuts cost $204.\\n\\nNext, she bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes. Each dozen costs $80. So, similar to the donuts, I need to calculate 2 times 80. 2 times 80 is 160. So, the cupcakes cost $160.\\n\\nThen, she bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and each dozen is $55. So, 6 times 55. Hmm, let me think. 6 times 50 is 300, and 6 times 5 is 30, so adding those together, 300 + 30 is 330. So, the cheesecakes cost $330.\\n\\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add up the cost of all the pastries. That would be the cost of donuts, cupcakes, and cheesecakes. So, that's $204 + $160 + $330. Let me add those together. \\n\\nFirst, 204 and 160. 200 + 160 is 360, and then plus the 4 is 364. Then, add 330 to that. 364 + 330. Let me break that down: 300 + 300 is 600, 60 + 30 is 90, and 4 + 0 is 4. So, 600 + 90 is 690, plus 4 is 694. So, altogether, the total cost is $694.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \\n\\nDonuts: 3 * 68. 3 times 60 is 180, 3 times 8 is 24, so 180 + 24 is 204. That seems right.\\n\\nCupcakes: 2 * 80 is 160. That's straightforward.\\n\\nCheesecakes: 6 * 55. 6 times 50 is 300, 6 times 5 is 30, so 300 + 30 is 330. That also seems correct.\\n\\nAdding them up: 204 + 160 is 364, and 364 + 330 is 694. Hmm, that adds up. So, I think that's the correct total.\\n\\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Each step seems to check out. So, the total cost is $694.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe total cost was \\\\boxed{694}.\\n</think>\\n\\nToula bought 3 dozen donuts costing $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes costing $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes costing $55 per dozen. \\n\\nFirst, calculate the cost of each item:\\n- Donuts: \\\\( 3 \\\\times 68 = 204 \\\\) dollars\\n- Cupcakes: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 80 = 160 \\\\) dollars\\n- Cheesecakes: \\\\( 6 \\\\times 55 = 330 \\\\) dollars\\n\\nNext, add the costs together:\\n- Total cost: \\\\( 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \\\\) dollars\\n\\nThus, the total cost was \\\\(\\\\boxed{694}\\\\).\",\n",

Each dozen of donuts costs $68. So, I need to calculate the total cost for the donuts. Let me write that down: 3 doxen (which is another word for dozen) times $68. So, 3 * 68.
